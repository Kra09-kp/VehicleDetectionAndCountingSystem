# Vehicle Detection and Counting System

Welcome to my vehicle detection and counting project! In this project, I've implemented a system to detect vehicles in videos and count them as they pass through a designated line. Below, you'll find details on the project setup, implementation, and how to reproduce the results.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection to identify vehicles in video footage. The primary objective is to count the number of vehicles passing through a specified line in the video. Two Python scripts, `tracker.py` and `test.py`, have been developed to facilitate this process.

## Video Data

All video files used in this project can be found in the `download.txt` file, which contains links to download each video. Additionally, the output videos generated by the system, showing the tracked vehicles and counting results, are also listed in the `download.txt` file.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to extend my gratitude to the following YouTube channels for their valuable tutorials and insights, which greatly assisted me in implementing this project:

- [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/c/CampusX-official)


## Implementation Details

### Object Tracking

`tracker.py` is responsible for tracking the detected vehicles and determining whether they have crossed the counting line. It utilizes advanced algorithms to track the center points of the vehicles and monitor their movement in the video frames.

### Counting Logic

`test.py` incorporates the counting logic, which detects when a vehicle's center point intersects with the designated counting line. This information is used to increment the vehicle count based on the direction of movement (upward or downward).

## Files

- `requirements.txt`: Contains the necessary Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.
- `coco.txt`: Provides a list of labels used for object detection, as per the COCO dataset.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the video files listed in `download.txt` for testing.
4. Run `tracker.py` and `test.py` to detect and count vehicles in the videos.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements! 

Thankyou for watching :)
